# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
3. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend will run on port 4000 by default, and the frontend on port 5173.

Open two tabs: one as a teacher, one as a student, to see real-time poll interaction.
